    "Project Summary -\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to understand the key factors that influence customer retention, repeat purchases, and marketing effectiveness in Zepto’s quick-commerce business model. This project focuses on identifying patterns across customer demographics, order behavior, delivery performance, and campaign exposure. Our analysis provides useful insights for quick-commerce businesses like Zepto to optimize delivery operations, improve loyalty programs, and enhance customer acquisition strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involved exploring and cleaning a dataset to prepare it for analysis. The data exploration process included understanding the structure of the dataset, checking data types, identifying missing values, and analyzing the distribution of important variables such as delivery time, average order value, and order frequency. The data cleaning process involved handling inconsistencies, removing duplicate records, treating outliers, and ensuring the dataset was reliable for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this process, we were able to fix data quality issues and ensure that the dataset was ready for meaningful business insights. Data preparation is a crucial step in any analytics project, as it helps avoid biases and errors that could affect final results. The cleaned dataset was then used to answer key research questions related to Zepto’s customer behavior and marketing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data was cleaned and prepared, we began exploring and summarizing it using descriptive statistics and visualization techniques. Various graphs and charts were created to uncover patterns and trends across multiple variables such as city-wise demand, delivery speed impact, campaign effectiveness, discount usage, and loyalty membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data visualization, we were able to better understand customer engagement and retention patterns that would be difficult to identify through raw data alone. For example, we found that delivery time, Zepto Pass membership, order frequency, and marketing campaign exposure play a significant role in determining repeat purchases. Additionally, metro cities showed higher customer activity, while Tier-II cities presented strong growth opportunities for expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observations and insights identified through this analysis are valuable for future decision-making in quick-commerce. This project demonstrates how Zepto’s speed-driven strategy, digital-first campaigns, and loyalty programs contribute to customer retention and competitive positioning in India’s growing quick-commerce market.\n",
